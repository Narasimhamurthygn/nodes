Tools to Create and Test Lambda-based Applications

Lambda Console: Provides a way for you to graphically design your Lambda-based application, author or update your Lambda function code, and configure event, downstream resources and IAM permissions that your function requires.

AWS CLI: A command-line interface you can use to leverage Lambda's API operations, such as creating functions and mapping event sources. For a full list of Lambda's API operations, see Actions.

AWS SAM CLI: A command-line interface you can use to develop, test, and analyze your serverless applications locally before uploading them to the Lambda runtime. For more information, see AWS SAM CLI in the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.
